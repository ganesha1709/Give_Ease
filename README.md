GIVE_EASE
 GiveEase is a web application for donating and receiving items.
 Users can create an account, log in as a Donor, Recipient, or NGO, and switch between roles.
 Donors can list items for donation by providing details and a photo, while Recipients can browse available items and claim them.
 The application dashboard allows users to track their donations and received items.
 The video also shows that the NGO role may be a feature still in development due to a console error.
 NOTE: please after sign up.....LOGIN TWO TIMES...(because of some issue.....i am trying to fix that issue)
